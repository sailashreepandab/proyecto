        <span>  Mixing contemporary designs with semi-precious stones and a dash of quirkiness, this label offers edgy customised jewellery. Agate is one stone they work with extensively and you can find it an array of dazzling hues like purple, sapphire blue, pink, orange, white and more. Glint offers lovely danglers, hook earrings and contemporary designs with matte gold detailing. Their green agate earrings simply won our hearts. Prices start from about INR 600. You can also shop for agate rings, bracelets, cufflinks and long malas made with colourful agate beads.
